# Fake Windows XP theme for Oh My Zsh

This is an awful cursed Oh My Zsh theme that transforms your prompt into something approximating a Windows XP command prompt.

The transformations are somewhat ad hoc for my specific directory structure so you may want to modify it as desired.

### Installation

To install this plugin, run the following from the repo folder:

```sh
ln themes/xp.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
```

If Oh My Zsh is installed somewhere else, change the path above to the appropriate directory.
